# Main Page
## About Me

Hi! I'm Micah, and I'm a teenage graphic designer, web developer, and musician living in Memphis, Tennessee. I'd love to work with you on any project!

## My Skills

I'm proficient in web development technologies such as HTML, Javascript, and CSS. I'm also experienced with GitHub, the Unix shell, and other such tools. I've created many graphic designs and logos that you can find on my [Dribbble account](https://dribbble.com/micahlt). If you'd like to check out some of my coding project, check out my [Experiments page](https://micahlt.github.io/experiments/).

## Get In Contact

I am eager to work with you on development and design projects! You can contact me using any of my social media platforms or get in touch via [email](mailto:micahincorporated@gmail.com) or [phone](tel:7319037085).
